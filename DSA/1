## 1. Core Resources

### Primary Recommendation
- **Book**: The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven Skiena
- **Strength**: Fosters enthusiasm for algorithmic problem-solving
- **Video Lectures**: [Skiena's online lectures](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/373/videos/)

### Alternative Resource
- **Course**: Tim Roughgarden's Algorithms Specialization
- **Platform**: [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)

## 2. Study Approach

1. Read The Algorithm Design Manual
2. Watch accompanying video lectures (Skiena's or Roughgarden's)
3. Solve problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
   - Aim for about 100 random problems
   - Focus on understanding solutions and discussions

## 3. Problem-Solving Skills

- **Book**: How to Solve It by George PÃ³lya
- **Focus**: General problem-solving techniques applicable to CS and mathematics

## 4. Practice and Application

1. Implement key algorithms and data structures
2. Analyze time and space complexity of your implementations
3. Apply learned concepts to solve diverse programming challenges

## 5. Interview Preparation

- Use LeetCode problems as interview practice
- Focus on explaining your thought process while solving problems

## 6. Additional Tips

- Choose resources based on your learning style (text vs. video)
- Consistency is key - regular practice is more effective than cramming
- Join online communities (Reddit, Stack Overflow) for discussions and help

Remember: The goal is not just to memorize algorithms, but to develop strong problem-solving skills and intuition for algorithmic thinking.

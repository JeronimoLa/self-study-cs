# Computer Architecture Learning Guide

[Building a Modern Computer from First Principles]
https://minnie.tuhs.org/Tecs/book/preface.pdf

## 1. Introductory Resources

### Primary Recommendation
- **Book**: Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective (CS:APP)
- **Focus**: Chapters 1-6
- **Strength**: Practical, programmer-oriented approach

### Alternative for Gentler Introduction
- **Book**: The Elements of Computing Systems (Nand2Tetris)
- **Focus**: First six chapters and associated projects
- **Resources**: 
  - [Free chapters and projects](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)
  - [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)

## 2. Study Plan

### Using CS:APP
1. Read chapters 1-6
2. Complete associated exercises and projects
3. Focus on understanding how software interacts with hardware

### Using Nand2Tetris
1. Work through chapters 1-6
2. Complete projects for each chapter
3. Build components from logic gates to CPU
4. Develop a basic assembler

## 3. Advanced Topics

After completing the introductory material:

1. Return to CS:APP for deeper dive
2. OR
3. Study Computer Organization and Design by Patterson and Hennessy
   - Follow Berkeley's CS61C course for guidance
   - Access [lecture notes and labs online](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp15/)
   - Watch [past lectures on Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL-XXv-cvA_iCl2-D-FS5mk0jFF6cYSJs_)

## 4. Key Concepts to Master
- Pipelining
- Memory hierarchy
- Relationship between architecture and software performance

## 5. Practice and Application
- Implement small projects that demonstrate architectural concepts
- Analyze performance impacts of architectural decisions on software

Remember: The goal is to understand computing below the surface of software, enabling you to write faster, more efficient, and more reliable programs.

## How to Measure Progress
- **Commit Regularly**: Document your progress by committing code and notes to a GitHub repository after each study session.
- **Use Issues & Milestones**: Track your tasks and goals using GitHub Issues and Milestones.
- **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your commit history and completed milestones to assess your progress.
